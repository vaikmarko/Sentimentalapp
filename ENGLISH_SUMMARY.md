## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Environment Detection System
```python
ENVIRONMENT = os.getenv('ENVIRONMENT', 'production')  # production, demo, test
IS_DEMO = ENVIRONMENT == 'demo'
IS_TEST = ENVIRONMENT == 'test'
```

### Mock Data System
- **5 Realistic English Stories**: Covering themes like career decisions, family memories, personal reflection
- **Emotional Analysis**: Consistent English emotions (positive, negative, neutral)
- **Story Connections**: Mock relationships between stories based on common themes
- **Inner Space Data**: Pre-generated visualization data for the story universe

### API Behavior by Environment

#### Demo Environment
```python
# GET /api/stories - Returns mock data
# POST /api/stories - Returns 403 with helpful message
{
  "error": "Cannot add new stories in demo environment",
  "message": "This is a demo version. Use the full version to add new stories."
}
```

#### Test/Production Environments
- Full CRUD operations
- Real Firebase database integration
- Complete text analysis with NLTK
- Story connection generation
