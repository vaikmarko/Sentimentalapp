        {"role": "user", "content": "Probably in high school when I realized how competitive pre-med would be. My parents started monitoring my grades obsessively, asking about everyone else's test scores. It became less about learning and more about being the best."},

        {"role": "user", "content": "My parents mean well, but they see my achievements as validation of their sacrifices. They immigrated here so I could have opportunities they never had. When I succeed, it feels like proof that it was all worth it."},
