- **Features**: Severity-based prioritization, auto-fix capabilities, fix strategies
- **Run**: `npm run fix:bugs`

## 🎯 Testing Workflows

### Complete System Validation
```bash
# Run everything in sequence
npm run test:all
```

This executes:
1. Database connectivity and CRUD tests
2. API endpoint validation
3. Component rendering tests
4. User flow validation
5. Performance testing
6. Bug analysis and prioritization
7. Automated fix attempts

### Individual Component Testing
```bash
# Test specific components
npm run test:share      # Share functionality
npm run test:stories    # Stories functionality  
npm run test:space      # Space (Inner Cosmos) functionality
npm run test:discover   # Discover functionality
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
npm run test:performance
```

### Bug Management
```bash
npm run fix:bugs           # Fix all priority bugs
npm run fix:critical       # Fix only critical bugs
npm run fix:high-priority  # Fix high-priority bugs
```

## 📊 Reports and Analysis

### Generated Reports
All reports are saved in the `/reports/` directory:

- `master-test-report.json` - Comprehensive test results
- `test-summary.md` - Human-readable summary
- `database-test-report.json` - Database test details
- `api-test-report.json` - API test results
- `user-flow-test-report.json` - User flow test results
- `bug-fix-report.json` - Bug fixing analysis

### Bug Tracking
Bug information is stored in `/bugs/` directory:
- Severity levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Automatic categorization and prioritization
- Fix strategies and estimated resolution times
- Status tracking (open, in-progress, resolved)

## 🔧 Core Functionality Testing

### Share → Story Flow
Tests the complete journey from user conversation to story creation:
1. User starts conversation
2. Messages are processed and saved
3. Story is generated from conversation
4. Story appears in user's collection
5. Story formatting and metadata validation

### Space Question Flow
Tests the knowledge system and curated conversations:
1. User asks question about themselves
2. System checks data sufficiency
3. If insufficient data → starts curated conversation
4. Conversation responses build knowledge base
5. System provides insights based on collected data

### Discovery Flow
Tests public story browsing and social features:
1. Public stories load correctly
2. Story interaction capabilities
3. Comment and reaction systems (when implemented)
4. Sharing functionality

### Data Building Process
Tests how user data accumulates and improves insights:
1. Multiple conversations create diverse data
2. Knowledge domains are built
3. Pattern recognition improves
4. Question responses become more accurate

## 🐛 Bug Severity Levels

### Critical (Fix Immediately)
- App crashes
- Database failures
- Security vulnerabilities
- Core functionality completely broken

### High (Fix within 24 hours)
- Share, Stories, or Space features not working
- API endpoints returning errors
- User flows broken

### Medium (Fix within 1 week)
- UI issues
- Performance problems
- Minor feature problems

### Low (Fix when time permits)
- Cosmetic issues
- Enhancement requests
- Non-critical optimizations

## 🔄 Continuous Testing

### Setup Continuous Testing
```bash
npm run continuous:test
```

This sets up automated testing that:
- Runs tests when code changes
- Immediately flags new bugs
- Updates bug priority lists
- Prevents deployment of broken code

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts the server and continuous testing in parallel.

## 📈 System Health Monitoring

npm run health:component
```

Detailed component-by-component health analysis.

## 🎛️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Set testing environment
export ENVIRONMENT=test

# Set custom base URL
export TEST_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Bug Tracker Configuration
Edit `bugs/bug-tracker.json` to customize:

## 📝 Adding New Tests

### Create Component Test
```javascript
// tests/component-tests/new-component-tests.js
const ComponentTestSuite = require('../base-test-suite');

class NewComponentTests extends ComponentTestSuite {
    async testNewFeature() {
        // Test implementation
    }
}

module.exports = NewComponentTests;
```

### Add to Master Runner
```javascript
// scripts/run-all-tests.js
const NewComponentTests = require('../tests/component-tests/new-component-tests');

// Add to test sequence
await this.runNewComponentTests();
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tests failing to connect to server:**
```bash
# Ensure server is running
python app.py

# Check if running on correct port
curl http://localhost:5000/api/stories
```

**Database connection errors:**
