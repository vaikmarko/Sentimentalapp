As I stare at the ceiling, I can't help but think, "I need to quit my job." It's a scary thought, like stepping off the edge of a cliff into the unknown. But as the days go by, this feeling only grows stronger, and I know I can't ignore it any longer.

I chose to pursue a career in marketing because I believed it would allow me to tap into my creativity and innovation. However, as I immersed myself in the industry, I quickly realized that my job was not about creating meaningful connections or making a positive impact. It was simply about manipulating people into buying things they don't need. I felt like a puppet master, pulling strings and making people dance to my tune."""
