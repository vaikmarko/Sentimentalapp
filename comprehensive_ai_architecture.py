SentimentalApp - Comprehensive AI Architecture
==============================================

This document outlines the strategic AI integration plan for SentimentalApp.
We focus on high-impact areas where AI genuinely improves user experience
while being mindful of costs and avoiding overengineering.

CORE PRINCIPLE: Use AI where it creates genuine value, not everywhere possible.

CONCLUSION:
This architecture focuses AI where it creates genuine value while using
rules-based approaches where they're sufficient. The result is a more
intelligent, personalized user experience without unnecessary costs.

Key principles:
- AI for creativity, empathy, and complex understanding
- Rules for logic, categorization, and simple decisions  
- Hybrid approaches for optimal cost/value balance
- Continuous optimization based on user feedback and metrics
