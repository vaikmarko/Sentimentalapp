Three months ago, this felt like the right decision - a fresh start, new opportunities, distance from everything familiar. But now, standing in my empty apartment with just two suitcases and a potted plant, I am questioning everything. The apartment smells like fresh paint and possibility.\n\nI walked to the corner store earlier and the cashier spoke to me in English. When I responded, she smiled and said the best time to visit the Golden Gate is early morning when the fog hasn\'t rolled in yet. Tonight I\'ll order takeout from a restaurant I\'ve never heard of, probably get lost walking back, and fall asleep to unfamiliar sounds outside my window. And somehow, that feels like exactly where I need to be.',

New city, new opportunities, fresh start. The decision made perfect sense on paper.\n\nToday, standing in my empty San Francisco apartment with nothing but two suitcases and a potted plant I somehow managed not to kill during the move, I\'m questioning everything. And you know what? That feels exactly right.\n\nThe apartment smells like fresh paint and possibility. It\'s smaller than my old place, more expensive, and the neighbors are strangers. But there\'s something electric about being somewhere completely new, where nobody knows your story yet.\n\nI walked to the corner store earlier - a simple errand that felt like an adventure. The cashier was friendly, told me the best time to see the Golden Gate Bridge is early morning before the fog rolls in. These small interactions feel precious when you\'re starting from scratch.\n\nTonight I\'ll order takeout from a restaurant I\'ve never heard of. I\'ll probably get lost walking back. I\'ll fall asleep to unfamiliar sounds outside my window. And somehow, all of that feels like exactly where I need to be.\n\nMoving across the country isn\'t just about changing your address. It\'s about giving yourself permission to become someone new, to write a different story. The uncertainty is terrifying and beautiful in equal measure.\n\nHere\'s to new beginnings and the courage to embrace the unknown.',

Just two people who grew in different directions.\n\nI\'m scared of learning to be myself again. For three years, I\'ve been half of \"us.\" Who am I when I\'m just... me?\n\nBut maybe that\'s the point.
